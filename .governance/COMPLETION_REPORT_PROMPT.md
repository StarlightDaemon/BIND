# Standard Agent Completion Report Prompt

**Context:** The Builder Agent has completed their implementation/reconstruction task.
**Target:** Starlight Carbon Architect (SCA).

## Instructions for the Agent
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your implementation task is complete. You must now generate a **Compliance & Implementation Report** to close the audit loop. 

Please provide your final response using the following structure:

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Accomplishments**: Briefly list what was built/reconstructed.
- **Compliance Status**: State clearly if 100% compliance with Starlight Carbon tokens was achieved.

### 2. Physical Changes (The "Where")
- **Files Created/Modified**: List the key files and their purpose.
- **Dependency Updates**: List any new packages added (e.g., `@carbon/react`).

### 3. Implementation Logic (The "How" & "Why")
- **Mapping Decisions**: Explain how you mapped old UI elements to new Carbon components.
- **Complexity Handled**: Describe any complex business logic you extracted or refactored.
- **Deviations**: If any "Drift" was necessary, explain the technical justification here (should match your Drift Report).

### 4. Verification Evidence
- **Validator Results**: Paste the summary of your `npm run validate` pass.
- **Audit Token**: Paste the content (or summary) of the `compliance-evidence.json` generated by `audit-collector.ts`.

### 5. Handover Notes
- **Known Issues**: Any minor polish items or future work identified.
- **SCA Action Req**: Any specific areas you want the Architect to forensic-audit more closely.
