# Standardized Project Structure Guide

## Overview
This document defines the standard directory structure for software development projects. It is designed to be readable by both **Human Developers** and **LLM Agents**, ensuring consistent organization, easy context retrieval, and clear separation of concerns.

## Root Directory Layout
The root of the project workspace should contain the following top-level directories. Do not clutter the root with loose files (except for `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and essential config).

```text
[Project Root]/
├── extension/ (or app/src)  <-- MAIN ACTIVE CODEBASE
├── research/                <-- LLM CONTEXT & KNOWLEDGE
├── legacy/                  <-- ARCHIVED CODE & ASSETS
├── other/                   <-- REFERENCE MATERIAL
└── backups/                 <-- INTERNAL SNAPSHOTS
```

## Directory Definitions

### 1. `extension/` (or `app/`, `src/`)
**Purpose**: Contains the **active, working source code** for the project.
**Naming**: Use a specific name if the project has multiple modules (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `extension`), otherwise `src` or `app` is acceptable.
**Rules**:
-   This is the **only** place where active development happens.
-   Build tools (e.g., `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`) reside here.
-   **LLM Instruction**: When asked to "write code" or "implement a feature", look here.

### 2. `research/`
**Purpose**: Stores knowledge, context, and research generated by or for LLMs.
**Contents**:
-   `context.md`: High-level project overview, goals, and architecture.
-   `prompts.md`: Reusable prompts or system instructions.
-   `*.md`: Research notes, API documentation summaries, brainstorming sessions.
**Rules**:
-   Do not put executable code here.
-   **LLM Instruction**: Read this folder to understand *what* to build and *why*.

### 3. `legacy/`
**Purpose**: Stores deprecated code, old versions, or original dumps that are no longer active but kept for reference.
**Contents**:
-   `v1_backup/`
-   `original_dump/`
-   `unused_assets/`
**Rules**:
-   Files here are **read-only**. Never modify them during active development.
-   **LLM Instruction**: Use this to find how things *used* to work, but do not import code from here into the active project.

### 4. `other/`
**Purpose**: Stores external reference material, similar open-source projects, or snippets from other sources.
**Contents**:
-   `reference_project_A/`
-   `snippets/`
**Rules**:
-   Isolated from the main codebase.
-   **LLM Instruction**: Use this for inspiration or pattern matching.

### 5. `backups/`
**Purpose**: Stores internal snapshots created before major refactors or risky changes.
**Contents**:
-   `pre_refactor_yyyy_mm_dd/`
-   `conversation_dumps/`
**Rules**:
-   Transient storage. Can be cleaned up periodically.

## Implementation Checklist for LLMs
When initializing or reorganizing a project, follow these steps:

1.  [ ] **Identify the Main Codebase**: Move active source code to `extension/` (or appropriate name).
2.  [ ] **Isolate Context**: Create `research/` and move any text-based context files there.
3.  [ ] **Archive Old Files**: Move deprecated files to `legacy/`.
4.  [ ] **Consolidate Clutter**: Move loose backups or temp folders to `backups/`.
5.  [ ] **Verify Config**: Ensure build scripts (e.g., `package.json`) point to the correct new paths.

## Naming Conventions
-   **Directories**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `my-project`, `user-auth`).
-   **Files**: Language specific (e.g., `PascalCase.tsx` for React, `camelCase.ts` for logic).
-   **Avoid**: Spaces, special characters, or generic names like `New Folder`.
