System Architecture & Design Brief

Project Scope: Development of a unified suite of open-source tools including Firefox Extensions, Dockerized Web Applications, and Dashboard Containers. Primary Goal: Achieve a unified "Brand Identity" and User Experience (UX) across disparate platforms (Browser vs. Server) while maintaining high reliability and easy deployment.

1. Core Technology Stack

The "Non-Negotiable" Foundation. All code generation should align with these standards unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

    Runtime & Language:

        Backend: Node.js (Latest LTS) with TypeScript (Strict Mode).

        Frontend: TypeScript with React (Next.js for web apps) or Vue 3 (for lightweight tools).

    Styling & Design System:

        Engine: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first).

        Component Philosophy: "Headless" components styled with Tailwind (e.g., Headless UI, Radix UI) or Web Components (Shoelace) for cross-platform portability.

        Theming: usage of CSS Variables (--primary, --bg-surface) to allow for easy "Dark Mode" and "Brand Theme" swapping.

    Infrastructure:

        Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose (Alpine Linux base images preferred for size).

        Database: SQLite (default for simplicity) with support for switching to Postgres if needed.

2. Design Aesthetic & "Vibe"

Visual Reference: The UI should feel "Native," "Professional," and "Responsive."

    Reference A (The Layout): Jellyseerr/Overseerr.

        Key Traits: Clean dashboard grids, "Skeleton" loading states (pulsing placeholders), translucent sidebars, mobile-responsive data tables.

    Reference B (The Polish): LibreChat / shadcn/ui.

        Key Traits: High-quality micro-interactions, accessible dialogs, clean typography, minimalist borders.

    Reference C (The Simplicity): Wizarr.

        Key Traits: Snappy performance, single-purpose setup screens, wizard-style flows.

3. Specific Implementation Constraints

A. For Firefox Extensions

    CSP Compliance: Strictly avoid eval() or new Function() to ensure Manifest V3 compliance.

    Style Isolation: Use Shadow DOM or scoped Tailwind classes/pre-fixes to prevent bleeding styles into host websites.

    Build Tool: Use Vite for bundling extension assets.

B. For Docker Containers

    Zero-Config: The container must start with sensible defaults. Use Environment Variables (ENV) for all configuration.

    Health Checks: Include a /health endpoint and Docker healthcheck instruction.

4. Coding Standards (LLM Instructions)

    Don't write Custom CSS: Always attempt to use standard Tailwind utility classes first. Only write custom CSS for complex animations.

    Type Safety: Do not use any. Define Interfaces for all data structures (especially API responses).

    Directory Structure:

        /src/components (Atomic UI elements)

        /src/features (Business logic bundles)

        /src/lib (Shared utilities)
